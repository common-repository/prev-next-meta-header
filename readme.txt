This plugin adds the prev/next meta tag to our blog header.

== Description ==

For SEO purposes we need to specify prev-next meta tag on our blog header. This action lets google or similar crawlers follow more easily our blog structure.

For example, on our blog installed on http://www.domain.tld/path/ if we are at our second page, this plugin will set this two headers.

<link rel="prev" href="http://www.domain.tld/path/">
<link rel="next" href="http://www.domain.tld/path/page/3/">
